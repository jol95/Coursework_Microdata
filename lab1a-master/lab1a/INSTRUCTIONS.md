# Instructions

Copy your `lab0b` files here. 

Change the name of the file `lab0b.s` to `lab1a.s` and update the `Makefile` accordingly. Then implement the subroutine "rev" <strong>using a frame pointer</strong>. Respect the D0013E calling convention (see "MIPS Programming") and don't forget to test your program in SyncSim.
